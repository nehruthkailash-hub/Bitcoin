# Bitcoin

## Project Description

**Bitcoin** is a revolutionary smart contract implementation that brings the core principles and functionality of Bitcoin to the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. This project recreates the fundamental characteristics of Bitcoin - digital scarcity, decentralized mining, and peer-to-peer value transfer - while leveraging smart contract capabilities for enhanced transparency and programmability.

The smart contract implements a complete Bitcoin-like ecosystem featuring:
- **Fixed Maximum Supply**: Exactly 21 million BTC tokens, mirroring Bitcoin's scarcity model
- **Proof-of-Work Mining**: Simulated mining process with difficulty adjustment and block rewards
- **Halving Events**: Automatic reward reduction every 210,000 blocks, preserving Bitcoin's deflationary mechanics
- **Blockchain Structure**: Complete block and transaction recording with Merkle tree validation
- **Wallet Management**: Comprehensive address-based wallet system with transaction history

This implementation serves as both an educational tool for understanding Bitcoin's core mechanics and a functional digital asset that maintains Bitcoin's essential properties while operating on Ethereum's robust smart contract platform.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create the most **authentic and comprehensive Bitcoin implementation** on smart contract platforms, serving as:

### 🏛️ **Digital Gold Standard**
